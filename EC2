1. What is Amazon EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service providing secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand.   

Key Features & Benefits
Reliability: Scale capacity within minutes with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) commitment of 99.99% availability.

Security: Built on the AWS Nitro System, ensuring security is integrated into the foundation of the compute service.   

Optimization: Flexible options to balance performance and cost, including:

AWS Graviton-based instances

Amazon EC2 Spot instances

AWS Savings Plans

2. EC2 Use Cases
EC2 is designed to meet demanding business needs by delivering the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services.   

General Business: Deliver secure, cost-effective infrastructure for diverse applications.

High Performance Computing (HPC): Run HPC applications faster and more cost-effectively with on-demand capacity.

Agile Development: Access environments in minutes and dynamically scale to benefit from pay-as-you-go pricing.   

Machine Learning (ML): Optimize price-performance for ML projects with purpose-built infrastructure.


Decoding Instance Names
EC2 instances use a naming convention based on Family and Capabilities.

Instance Families (The First Letter)
C – Compute

D – Dense storage   

F – FPGA   

G – GPU

Hpc – High performance computing   

I – I/O

Inf – AWS Inferentia   

M – Most scenarios (General Purpose)

P – GPU (High performance)

R – Random access memory (RAM)

T – Turbo (Burstable performance)   

Trn – AWS Trainium   

U – Ultra-high memory   

VT – Video transcoding

X – Extra-large memory

Additional Capabilities (The Suffix)
a – AMD processors   

g – AWS Graviton processors

i – Intel processors

d – Instance store volumes (fast, local storage)

n – Network and EBS optimized

e – Extra storage or memory

z – High performance   

5. EC2 Basics & Lifecycle
Core Concepts
Virtual Servers: Understanding that instances are virtualized servers running on physical hardware.   

AMI (Amazon Machine Image): The template that contains the software configuration (OS, application server, applications) required to launch your instance.   

Purchasing Options:

On-Demand: Pay for compute capacity by the second/hour with no long-term commitment.   

Reserved: Significant discount compared to On-Demand in exchange for a 1 or 3-year commitment.   

Spot: Request spare compute capacity for up to 90% off the On-Demand price.

Launching an Instance
Console: Use the AWS Management Console to start the launch wizard.

Configuration:

Select an AMI (Operating System).

Choose an Instance Type (e.g., t3.micro).

Configure Network Settings (VPC, Subnet).   

Add Storage (EBS volumes).

Security:

Security Groups: Act as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic.   

Key Pairs: Used to securely login to the instance (required for SSH).

Managing Instances
Lifecycle Actions: You can Start, Stop (like shutting down a laptop, keeps data), and Terminate (deletes the instance and typically its root storage) instances.   

Monitoring: Track performance (CPU, Network I/O) via AWS CloudWatch.   

Access: Connect to your instance securely using SSH (Linux/Mac) or RDP (Windows)
